# Two-level SRAM and mixed-phase hardware gate

The gate tests one prefill projection and one single-query decode score
contraction. It uses 8-bit tensors and 2,048 MACs at 1 GHz. The two SRAM levels
hold shared data and stripe-private weights, respectively. The experiment
varies the PE geometry, global bank count, global capacity per bank, and
private capacity per stripe.

The [pinned CACTI run](https://github.com/HaoningJiang-space/accelforge-streaming-dse/actions/runs/42453899987)
characterizes 45 nm scratchpads with one dedicated read port and one dedicated
write port. The [macro table](results/sram_45nm.json) records area, dynamic
read and write energy, standby leakage, and access and cycle time. A stripe
has one private macro. The shared SRAM is built from separate global macros.
The budget covers these SRAMs. MAC and register counts are fixed, and
interconnect layout area is outside the model.

Native bit counts are prorated against 64-bit private and 512-bit global
transactions. The initial service model assumes evenly distributed global
bank traffic and rounds each bank's access and cycle times up to whole
1 GHz cycles. The one-bank sensitivity keeps all SRAM area and leakage
and limits the global service rate to one bank. Neither service mode
resolves addresses to individual bank calendars.

The mapper generates native tile rows independently at each hardware point.
The EDP calculation adds the energy and time of both phases before
multiplying. The independent-hardware relaxation combines the full energy and
time fronts of both phases across the same area-capped hardware points.
Both architecture-first controls retain all ties and remap both phases
with the physical costs. One uses a fixed-price, zero-leakage proxy to choose
hardware. The other chooses hardware using only the prefill phase.

## Cold decode

The 512-token cold scan covered 15 hardware points across three area caps.
At 16, 64, and 256 decode steps, the shared-hardware penalties were 1.37%,
1.83%, and 2.00% at each cap. Prefill-first followed by full remapping tied
the shared optimum in all nine cases. The nine shared EDP values reproduced
exactly on Windows with the same CACTI table.
